Tools for **s**ingle **c**ell **o**ptimal-**t**ransport **t**rajector**y** models.

This package implements methods for interfacing with optimal transport trajectory models for time-resolved single-cell data. Analysis tools in this package include:

* Visualization of "fate flows" via Sankey diagrams.
* Trajectory Kernel Mean Embedding (TKME) integration.
* Conditional fate probability computation.
* Fate entropy computation.
